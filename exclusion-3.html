    <h2>Rodent and Wildlife Exclusion Program<br><span class="heading3">Warranty Certificate</span></h2>

    <p class="centeredText"><strong>Thank you for choosing Simpson Pest Control. Due to the
            high demand for this
            service
            Simpson Pest Control is one of the only companies to offer a renewable warranty that continues to protect
            your
            home long after we have solved the initial rodent or wildlife issue. This warranty covers your home for re
            baiting and trapping for rodentâ€™s, as well as sealing any new entry points if created by rodents or
            wildlife.
            Exclusion jobs can be quite costly so by offering a renewable warranty we can protect you from another
            possibly
            high expense. As long as your yearly renewal's are paid on time and your inspection completed you're covered
            for
            any new activity and or entry points. Warranty does not apply to partial or single point exclusions. All
            exclusion services come with a 30 day rodent trapping program. It is highly recommended that a monthly
            monitoring program be put in place to continue to monitor your home.</strong></p>

    <p class="section-title">Understanding your warranty:</p>
    <p>You have two options when choosing your warranty.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Rodent Exclusion Warranty with Simpson Pest Control  Services.</li>
        <li>Rodent Exclusion Warranty without Simpson Pest Control  Services.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The coverage for the two are the same. However, the cost is exclusive to the services you have with us that are
        pre existing or that you purchase along with your exclusion program. Qualifying programs are recurring pest,
        termite, mosquito, or monthly rodent monitoring. Any of these programs count as an ongoing service.</p>
    <p>Our <strong>Renewable warranty</strong> when not bundled with any of our services will cost you $269.00 yearly
        <span class="highlight-orange">(Price can vary depending on the square footage of the home)</span>.
    </p>
    <p>If <strong>not bundled</strong> with one of our ongoing services your renewal will cost you $289.00 yearly
        <span class="highlight-orange">(Price can vary depending on square footage of the home)</span>.
    </p>

    <p>Your annual payment is due 360 days after initial service each year and will continue to be renewed every 360
        days or until you request that it be canceled. Your warranty is also transferable. If you should choose to sell
        the home or the property should change hands the new resident can have the warranty transferred into their name
        and the coverage will continue as before. There is a $150 transfer fee that is required along with a visual
        inspection to make sure the home is still properly excluded according to the agreement on file.</p>

    <p>This certificate is proof of your coverage, if at any time you wish to cancel the warranty, you must notify
        Simpson Pest Control 30 days prior to your intent to cancel. Canceling by email is acceptable.</p>
