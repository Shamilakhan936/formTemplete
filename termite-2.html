        <h1>CONSUMER INFORMATION SHEET</h1>
        <p>
            The structural pest control industry is regulated by the Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA), Structural
            Pest Control Service (SPCS), P.O. Box 12847, Austin, TX 78711-2847. TDA licenses the businesses, certified
            applicators, technicians, and registered apprentices who perform structural pest control work. Certified
            applicators and technicians must pass a written examination in order to receive their licenses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pesticides must be registered with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and TDA before
            they may be used in Texas. EPA registration is not a finding of product safety. Pesticides are designed to
            kill or control pests. Your risk of harm depends upon the degree of your exposure and your individual
            susceptibility.
        </p>
        <p>
            Specific health and safety information varies between pesticides and types of exposures and is available on
            the label information or SDS sheet, which can be supplied to you upon request from the licensed applicator.
            Take precautions when a treatment has been performed to avoid exposure to vulnerable individuals. Pesticides
            may be harmful if swallowed, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin. Avoid breathing dust or spray mist and
            any unnecessary contact with treated surfaces. If you desire specific information on precautions, refer to
            the pesticide label. The law requires that the application procedures specified on the label be followed.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have questions about the application, contact the business or person making the application. If you
            suspect a violation of the law regarding structural pest control, contact the SPCS. In case of a health
            emergency, seek immediate medical attention.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pest Control signs must be posted prior to treatment in many instances. The signs should be posted in an
            area of common access at least 48 hours prior to treatment. The information sign will allow you to contact
            someone who can tell you what pesticide is being used.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are contracting for pest control services due to a home solicitation, you have the right to cancel
            the contract within 72 hours. You may exercise this right by notifying the pest control company that you do
            not wish to receive their service.
