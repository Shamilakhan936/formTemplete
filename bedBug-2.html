            <h3>Bedbug Specific Terms and Conditions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If more than 100 bed bugs are present during the initial visit or subsequent follow ups additional work at additional fees may be necessary</li>
                <li>This service agreement can be terminated at any time by the contracting party with no financial penalty. However, if <span class="company">the company</span> is contacted at any time in the future for treatment of bed bugs at this location, the treatments are subject to the terms of a new agreement.</li>
                <li><span class="company">The company</span> may revise the fees for future services with notice to the client; to include follow up visits.</li>
                <li>If a representative from <span class="company">the company</span> arrives for a scheduled visit and cannot perform the work due to our inability to gain entry into the structure, or preparations for treatment have not been performed, a charge equivalent to 40% of the charge of the scheduled service will be applied.</li>
                <li>Failure to find visible evidence of bed bugs during an inspection does not insure that the area inspected is free of bugs. Bed bugs can easily escape visual detection, particularly when low level infestations are present and during the early stages of an infestation.</li>
                <li>Clients will be expected to respond to brief written surveys as part of the follow up procedure. Failure to respond to these surveys may prevent the infestation from being declared "under control" or "eliminated" and may prolong the length of the program.</li>
                <li>There is no guarantee that bed bugs will be eliminated from the treated site. The 90 day service warranty is only effective if "elimination" is declared and this is subject to a variety of factors to include client cooperation in following recommendations, physical conditions of the structure etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The client agrees to all provisions of the Verification Inspection (if applicable).</p>
            <p>The client agrees to all provisions of Follow-up Services for Bed bugs and understands all follow-up services discussed in this agreement are bound by the Terms of the Follow-up Inspection terms and conditions.</p>
